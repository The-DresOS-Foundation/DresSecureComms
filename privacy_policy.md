# Privacy Policy for DresSecureComms

**Last Updated:** July 2026
**Applies to:** DresSecureComms 1.8.1 (versionCode 12) and later

*Changed in this revision: File Scan can now upload a file to VirusTotal, but only one file at a time and only when you choose to after being told exactly what that means. Scanning still sends nothing but a fingerprint by default, and a sweep of your installed apps never uploads anything.*

DresSecureComms is a free, open-source, and de-Googled secure communications application built for the DresOS defensive security ecosystem. We believe in absolute user privacy. 

### 1. No Data Collection or Tracking
DresSecureComms does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, telemetry, or analytics. There are no user accounts, no key servers, and no background tracking. All your messages, call logs, and contacts remain strictly on your physical device.

### 2. Permission Justifications
Because DresSecureComms is designed to replace your device's default Dialer and SMS applications to provide a secure, offline-first environment, it requires sensitive Android permissions. Here is exactly why each is needed:

* **SMS & MMS Permissions (`RECEIVE_SMS`, `SEND_SMS`, `READ_SMS`, etc.):** Required to act as your default SMS application. This allows the app to receive, display, and optionally encrypt your text messages locally.
* **Phone & Call Log Permissions (`CALL_PHONE`, `READ_CALL_LOG`, `READ_PHONE_STATE`, etc.):** Required to act as your default Phone/Dialer application and Caller ID/Spam shield. This allows the app to place carrier calls and manage your local call history.
* **Contacts (`READ_CONTACTS`):** Used *only* if you explicitly choose to import your device's contacts into the app's encrypted local vault.
* **Location (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION`):** Used exclusively for the "Geo Spoofer" privacy feature, allowing you to mask your real GPS coordinates from other invasive apps on your device.
* **Internet (`INTERNET`):** The app is entirely offline for messaging and calling. The Internet permission is used **strictly and solely** to connect to the VirusTotal API, and only when you manually run a scan yourself. "Threat Scan" sends a URL you paste in. "File Scan" sends the SHA-256 fingerprint of a file or app. The file itself is uploaded only when VirusTotal has never seen that fingerprint **and you then choose to send it**, one file at a time, from a prompt that spells out that the file leaves your phone and that VirusTotal shares what it receives. Nothing is uploaded automatically, and a sweep of your installed apps never uploads anything.
* **Biometrics (`USE_BIOMETRIC`):** Used to unlock the app via the App Lock feature.

### 3. Call Screening
The Spam Shield runs **entirely on your device**. Incoming numbers are checked against rules you control and against your own contacts and block list, all held locally. No phone number is ever transmitted to us or to any third party for lookup, and there is no crowd-sourced or cloud spam database involved. Numbers the shield blocks are listed in Settings so you can review or undo any of them at any time.

### 4. Cryptography and Security
* **Local Encryption:** Your contacts vault and sent-message logs are encrypted at rest using keys generated and stored securely in the hardware-backed **Android Keystore**.
* **Message Encryption:** Optional peer-to-peer message encryption uses **AES-256-GCM**. The encryption key is a passphrase you agree out-of-band with the other person. Keys are held per contact, so each conversation can use a different code, and they are stored encrypted at rest behind the Android Keystore. The app never transmits any key.
* **Biometric Hardening:** The App Lock feature uses Android's `BiometricPrompt` tied directly to a cryptographic `CryptoObject` in the Keystore, ensuring the app cannot be bypassed by memory hooking tools.

### 5. Third-Party Services
DresSecureComms contains **zero** third-party trackers, ads, or Firebase/Google Play Services. The only external network connection made is to `virustotal.com`, and only when you manually run Threat Scan or File Scan yourself, using your own personal API key. File Scan transmits a fingerprint of a file. It transmits the file itself only for a single file you have explicitly chosen to upload after being warned.

### 6. Open Source
DresSecureComms is fully open-source. You can audit the code, verify the permissions, and build the app yourself from our official GitHub repository.
